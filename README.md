# Currency-Converter

This is a currency converter web application that allows users to convert between different currencies. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and utilizes a public API to fetch the latest exchange rates.

## Features

- **Currency Conversion**: Convert an amount from one currency to another.
- **Real-time Exchange Rates**: Fetches up-to-date exchange rates from a reliable API.
- **Interactive UI**: Dropdowns to select currencies, input for amount, and a button to get the conversion rate.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the web page, including layout, colors, and fonts.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching data from the API and updating the DOM based on user interactions.
- **API**: Uses the [Currency API](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api) to get the latest exchange rates.

   ```bash
